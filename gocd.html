GoCD
</b>
 - Continuous Delivery

 </h1>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A look at 'go' by Candace Hicks and Kaitlyn Glodde
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this demo, we will demonstrate how GoCD works and how to use it, as well as show GoCD in action. 
We will show you how you can see how your workflow really works, as well as some code coverage with GoCD. 
We will also discuss the software required for the use of GoCD, and other helpful programs.</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GoCD is an open source software tool that is used for continuous delivery and to visualize complex workflows easily. 
It allows the user to model complex workflows with its fan-in, fan-out dependency management system.

In order to understand goCD, you will have to understand some of the vocabulary that they use.
There are four very important terms that you will come across when using this tool. The words <b>pipeline, stage, job, and task</b>.
An example of a pipeline is shown below. 
<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "task.png" alt = ""/>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Each pipeline has a stage, a stage consists of jobs and inside each job, there is a task. There can be 
more or fewer of each depending on the project. All of these make up the pipeline.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task
</b>
A task id usually a command that is used to run the job. Not every task is simple, although there are 
many options for you to already choose from. You can use plugins as well such as 
repository pollers. There exists pollers for Maven, Debian, Puppet Forge, and many others.
A repository poller is basically just a way to take something from a main repository. When you tell goCD to "poll for changes", 
you are telling it to update your pipeline every time something changes. This is called a trigger.

Some options that are already given to you would be NAnt, Ant, and Rake. 
We will be using our own command called ./build. 

</p>


<p>
<b>Job</b>
A job is a list or collection of tasks. Each task in a job will execute one after another.
If anything fails in an execution, then nothing after it will execute. They are dependent on one another. 


</p>
<p>
<b>
Stage</b>
A stage is a collection of jobs but it is non-sequential meaning that nothing inside of the stage has to be in any 
particular order. No job relies on another. This makes it possible for GoCD to run in parallel.
</p>

<h2>
Setup
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can download GoCD from <a href="https://www.gocd.io/download/">the GoCD website</a>. 
It is suggested that you use a 64-bit server with a 32-bit agent, so that is what we did.  
We followed the prompts for installation on both, making sure we bundled JRE instead of specifying the location of our JDK so that there were no future issues for us. 
The agent can also be found at the same URL. 
For our agent, we left the URL blank so that the default would be set to the local host. 
GoCD made it's own icon based on default. We clicked it and it brought up GoCD in Google Chrome. 
There are three steps listed. 
</p>


<p>
Figure 1 is the first screen that will appear when you run goCD. It has 3 basic steps listed below.
</p>

<br></br>


<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic2forgocd.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 1 - Basic Settings </p></center>

<p><b>
Step 1:
</b> 
Basic Settings - We set up our Pipeline name as MyFirstPipeline and the Pipeline Group Name as Demo. 
You can then click next.
</p>
<p>
<b>
Step 2:
</b> Materials - There is an option for material type. 
Under this, there are several things listed. 
For example, there is subversion, git, mercurial, etc. 
For now, we chose Git as the "Material Type" and for the URL, we are using a simple "Hello World" example given from the goCD website.
You can find the link here  https://github.com/gocd-contrib/getting-started-repo. 
Although this seems almost too simple, you can also run it on any Git repository of your choosing.

GoCD will be looking at the master branch. 
You may keep your settings at default. "poll for new changes" is already marked, so we kept that as default. 
We then checked the connection to make sure GoCD understands the URL it was given.
You can then continue to the next step given to you in Figure 2.
</p>

</p><p>Figure 2 - Defining the Job</p></center>
<br></br>
<p>
<b>
Step 3:
</b> Stage/Job - Stage name is Stage1. Job Name - defaultJob. 
We changed the task type to "more..." and put in "./build" for the command and pressed finish. 
There are also other built-in options for you to choose from. Depending on your repository,
you may want to use what has already been given. Pipeline is now made. 
The ./build function seems the easiest to work with. 

</p>


<h2>
Building</h2>
<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic5.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 3 - Screen After Setup</p></center>
<p>
The setup is done, however it will not start to run until you press the pause button in the top left 
corner.
The pause button is set to "on" right after setup in case you want to change any other settings.
If you would like to keep the default settings, you can continue and press the button.
</p>
<br></br>


<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic6.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 4 - Running the Pipeline</p></center>
<p>
Once you give goCD permission to run, you will see this yellow bar pop up. This means that it is running.
It should not take long to run if you are only running it on a small program.
<br></br>



<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic7.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 5 - Running Completed</p></center>
<p>
Soon after allowing it to run, it should turn green like above in Figure 5 as long as it has successfully completed.
Sometimes it will turn red. This means that the program has failed.
You can click on the green bar to see information about your repository.
Clicking the green bar tells you the last commit that was made on the repo.
This is a nice feature because you can look back at old models of your program and compare and see what went wrong.

</p>
<br></br>



<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic8.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 6 - Overview</p></center>
<p> 

You can see the status of our "defaultStage" in Figure 6. You are able to see the last Git commit that someone last made under the revision.
Here, the commit is made by Aravind SV under the README document. 
It shows you the last commit so that you can compare different pipelines and keep track of what the pipeline looked like earlier on in production.

You can see on the left GoCD keeps track of the different jobs you have made for the repo.
We have only run 1 job so we have "Passed: 1". None are in progress and none failed.

Towards the top, you can see how long it took GoCD to run on the repo along with the exact 
time that it was triggered. If you have a series of jobs for GoCD to perform, this may be helpful to you.
You can run tests to see which jobs take longer on your repo than others and make 
assumptions as to what you could fix to make it faster.

<h2>
Tool Evaluation
</h2>
<p>
<b>
Time to Install
</p>
</b>
<p>
Installation did not take much time at all. All you need is the Go server and a Go agent.
You can download more than one agent but there could be problems running GoCD if you do. 
You can easily find the links on their website to install and it is as 
simple as running the executables and going through the prompts.
 There are no other extra steps unless you want to have special settings - or if you want to 
 link your JDK to the server yourself.

</p>
<p>
<b>
User Friendliness
</b></p><p>
This is not very user friendly. Finding your way around the tool was not easy. Some of the settings
are vague and you have to look up a lot of the descriptions for the terms they use on their website.
 For example, you need to know a lot of different vocabulary that isn't really used - or at least not that often - in
 software. 
I think the "task" section on their website could use some more explaining. I understood how to use the build 
but they also had Rake, Ant, and NAnt, which i'm not all that familiar with. Instead 
of being able to go on to their website, you have to make use of other resources which i found 
tedious. 
 </p>


<h2>
Usefulness
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GoCD is useful for large files. It will show you mapping between different files. 
This is important when you want to see what relies on something else. 
The pipeline will execute each file based on the hierarchy and you are able to see which files are children to parents. 
You are also able to see exact git commits made by someone at a certain time and see the product growing over time.  
It gives you a lot of visibility into  who's doing what.

<b>
Pipeline Dependencies
</b>
You can also have pipeline dependency. Pipelines can trigger as a result of another pipeline finishing
or a stage of a pipeline finishing. You can do so by adding pipelines as materials. 
<br>
</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can see any stage at any time, allowing you to keep track of good and bad versions of your product. 
You will be able to compare builds. This will increase reliability and if you need, you can make it secure without having to 
secure it for every run. 
</p>
<h2>
Downfalls
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Top level pipelines can execute in parallel. An agent helps execute. 
In theory, you should want more agents for parallelization. 
If you only have one agent, this means that all processes will be waiting until the agent is done with it's current process. 
For our purposes, we have only downloaded one agent to see everything done one after another. 
Using extra agents can also cause problems - such as if agent 1 tries to run "stage 1" and agent 2 tries to run "stage 2",
 it will most likely not work because agent 1 and 2 are not given the same information. 
While building your pipeline with GoCD, children will execute based on their hierarchy. 
You may start with a green value stream, meaning that everything is "good to go" but it may change once you reach a certain part of the pipeline. 
You can have a yellow value stream or a red value stream. Yellow means that it is building and red is failing. 
When something fails, it will not tell you directly, you will have to go and dig in to the problem yourself.
