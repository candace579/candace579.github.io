GoCD
</b>
 - Continuous Development

 </h1>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A look at 'go' by Candace Hicks and Kaitlyn Glodde
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this demo, we will demonstrate how GoCD works and how to use it, as well as show GoCD in action. 
We will show you how you can see how your workflow really works, as well as some code coverage with GoCD. 
We will also discuss the software required for the use of GoCD, and other helpful programs.</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GoCD is an open source software tool that is used for continuous delivery and to visualize complex workflows easily. 
It allows the user to model complex workflows with its fan-in, fan-out dependency management system.</p>
<h2>
Setup
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can download GoCD from <a href="https://www.gocd.io/download/">the GoCD website</a>. 
It is suggested that you use a 64-bit server with a 32-bit agent, so that is what we did.  
We followed the prompts for installation on both, making sure we bundled JRE instead of specifying the location of our JDK so that there were no future issues for us. 
The agent can also be found at the same URL. 
For our agent, we left the URL blank so that the default would be set to the local host. 
GoCD made it's own icon based on default. We clicked it and it brought up GoCD in Google Chrome. 
There are three steps listed. 
</p>


<p>
Figure 1 is the first screen that will appear when you run goCD. It has 3 basic steps listed below.
</p>

<br></br>

</p><p>Figure 1 - Basic Settings </p></center>

<p><b>
Step 1:
</b> 
Basic Settings - We set up our Pipeline name as MyFirstPipeline and the Pipeline Group Name as Demo. 
You can then click next.
</p>
<p>
<b>
Step 2:
</b> Materials - There is an option for material type. 
Under this, there are several things listed. 
For example, there is subversion, git, mercurial, etc. 
For now, we chose Git as the "Material Type" and for the URL, we are using a simple "Hello World" example given from the goCD website.
You can find the link here  https://github.com/gocd-contrib/getting-started-repo. 
Although this seems almost too simple, you can also run it on any Git repository of your choosing.

GoCD will be looking at the master branch. 
You may keep your settings at default. "poll for new changes" is already marked, so we kept that as default. 
We then checked the connection to make sure GoCD understands the URL it was given.
You can then continue to the next step given to you in Figure 2.
</p>

</p><p>Figure 2 - Defining the Job</p></center>
<br></br>
<p>
<b>
Step 3:
</b> Stage/Job - Stage name is Stage1. Job Name - defaultJob. 
We changed the task type to the ./build command and we pressed finish. Pipeline is now made. 
It is important when using Git repositories that you use the ./build function or else it may fail.
</p>


<h2>
Building</h2>
<p><center>

</p><p>Figure 3 - Screen After Setup</p></center>
<p>
The setup is done, however it will not start to run until you press the pause button in the top left corner.
The pause button is set to "on" right after setup in case you want to change any other settings.
If you would like to keep the default settings, you can continue and press the button.
</p>
<br></br>


<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic6.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 4 - Running the Pipeline</p></center>
<p>
Once you give goCD permission to run, you will see this yellow bar pop up. This means that it is running.
It should not take long to run if you are only running it on a small program.
<br></br>



<p><center>
<img class = "IMG" src = "pic7.png" alt = ""/>

</p><p>Figure 5 - Running Completed</p></center>
<p>
Soon after allowing it to run, it should turn green like above in Figure 5 as long as it has successfully completed.
Sometimes it will turn red. This means that the program has failed.
You can click on the green bar to see information about your repository.
</p>
<br></br>

</p><p>Figure 6 - Overview</p></center>
<p> 

You can see the status of our "defaultStage" in Figure 6. You are able to see the last Git commit that someone last made under the revision.
It shows you the last commit so that you can compare different pipelines and keep track of what the pipeline looked like earlier on in production.

<h2>
Usefulness
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GoCD is useful for large files. It will show you mapping between different files. 
This is important when you want to see what relies on something else. 
The pipeline will execute each file based on the hierarchy and you are able to see which files are children to parents. 
You are also able to see exact git commits made by someone at a certain time and see the product growing over time.  
It gives you a lot of visibility into  who's doing what.
<br>
</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can see any stage at any time, allowing you to keep track of good and bad versions of your product. 
You will be able to compare builds. This will increase reliability and if you need, you can make it secure without having to 
secure it for every run. 
</p>
<h2>
Downfalls
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Top level pipelines can execute in parallel. An agent helps execute. 
In theory, you should want more agents for parallelization. 
If you only have one agent, this means that all processes will be waiting until the agent is done with it's current process. 
For our purposes, we have only downloaded one agent to see everything done one after another. 
Using extra agents can also cause problems - such as if agent 1 tries to run "stage 1" and agent 2 tries to run "stage 2",
 it will most likely not work because agent 1 and 2 are not given the same information. 
While building your pipeline with GoCD, children will execute based on their hierarchy. 
You may start with a green value stream, meaning that everything is "good to go" but it may change once you reach a certain part of the pipeline. 
You can have a yellow value stream or a red value stream. Yellow means that it is building and red is failing. 
When something fails, it will not tell you directly, you will have to go and dig in to the problem yourself.
